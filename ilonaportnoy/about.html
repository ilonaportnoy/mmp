<!--Who I am -->
<p align="center" style="color:hotpink;" <b><font face="verdana" size="2.5"> 
	Hi! I'm Ilona Portnoy, a 20 year old student at BMCC. I'm currently a liberal arts major and am planning to finish school this fall and go to cosmetology school. I have been fascinated with creating and designing things from a very young age but have only recently discovered that is the path I'd like to take in my profession. 
	</p>
<!-- What I do -->
 <p align="center" style="color:hotpink;" <b><font face="verdana" size="2.5"> 
 	Makeup, photography/videography, and editing are things I do daily for myself and my personal growth, as well as occasionally giving others a helping hand in the fields. I am currently halfway through a multimedia production course in which I have had the opportunity to exercise all my talents in various ways and I couldn't be happier with the results. I'm really excited to continue expressing my artistic side through my work as well as providing for those who need my creative services.
